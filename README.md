- [Cors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors)



## Getting Started


You must to go both file directories(backend and frontend) and run following commands

```
npm install
```

You must assign dotenv variables for both and start the dev server (in this case, I already made .env file, so only start server is needed)

```
npm start
```

I have made frontend with React.js based on React Hook, and made backend using Express framework.
And I've used Mongodb for database and cloudinary platform (https://cloudinary.com/) for storing images.

To simplify this app, I don't made admin panel separetly, instead of this, you can use admin panel credentails for adding and editing categories.

Admin credential : 
    email : admin@gmail.com
    Password : root123!@#

Basic users can register on this app and then can login using their credentials
